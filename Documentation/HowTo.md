# HowTo

(I did my work in windows 10, so you may encounter problems in linux)

- Root folder has a jar (with all dependencies) which should run by itself.

- You can also run gradlew from project root in terminal

- If all else fails, front page has matrixcacltodo.txt with some suggestions to run from main.

- GUI is hopefully pretty self explanatory. Only square matrices work (for now atleast?). Watch out for longer tests. Something
like 2^8 and 800-900 shoud still run smoothly. Also you can't close the GUI while tests are running, limitation of the programming
choices I guess
