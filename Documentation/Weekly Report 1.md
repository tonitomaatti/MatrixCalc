# Week 1

This week I set up the needed programs, the project structure and the Github page. I also found the right algorithms
for the needed matrix operations and their time complexities. I learned the mathematical ideas behind the algorithms. Next up
is the first actual implementation of the operations.

I'm still uncertain of the right data structures and space complexities.

Time used: 4 hours.
