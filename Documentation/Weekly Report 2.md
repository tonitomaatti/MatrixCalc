# week 2

This week I tried to do a little bit of everything that was mentioned in the timetable. Unfortunately for quite a while I mistakenly thought the deadline was on sunday (which was the case on database project instead), but luckily I had time to try out some things. The mistake was all my fault of course. I should be able to catch up for next week.

Mostly I just read up on the techical things: Javadoc, gradle and Junit. I completed the 'OTM' course by exam only, so I was still quite unfamiliar with the technical side.

As far as actual progress goes:

- I made a folder for javadoc on the front page and linked to web-page version in the readme-file. I tried to add some descriptions for the classes. For some reason had a hard time getting netbeans to produce the javadoc files.

- Made two (possibly quite temporary) classes just to test things out.
    ..- __MatrixScanner__ is a way to input a matrix for now. It's done by runtime user input. Will probably change this to file input later on. I wonder if one could use excell files?
    ..- __Addition__ takes two matrices, adds them together and returns the resulting matrix. Addition will remain in some form but will be obviously overhauled.
    
 - Made one test class to test addition when you have matrices of the same size. The class still obvioulsy fails with matrices of different sizes.
 
 The code remains quite messy for now, although quite likely almost everything will get overhauled anyway.


Next I will start working on classes for the actually interesting algorithms (multiplication and determinant). And hopefully start figuring out appropriate data structures.
