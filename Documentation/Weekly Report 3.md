# Week 3

The functionality of the program is basically done. The program can now:
 - Add
 - Substract
 - Multiply (Strassen)
 - Produce a determinant (Doolittle)
 
Next I am going to improve the structure of the project (file structure, logical classes, single responsibility...).

The most advanced java file structure used for now is 2-dimensional array int[][]. Will replace this with my own?

According to jacoco, unit tests are almost 100% for everything but matrixScanner -class (and main). Didn't have time to figure out unit tests for scanner and the class is going to be replaced with more advanced input option anyway.

Time spent: 12 hours
