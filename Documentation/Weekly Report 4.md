# Week 4

Time Spent: 12 hours

This week I:

- Refactored the project to follow a layered architecture.
- Cleaned up code according to good principles
- Did a test class to do some time analysis
- Did some time analysis for multiplication and determinant
- Started implementation and performance documents
- Updated javadoc, unit tests and jacoco

Jacoco gives good coverage for domain files for unit testing. Other classes really don't matter for now. TextUI and matrix scanner
are kinda outdated by now. With GUI comes the final version for UI and I/O files. For now stuff should be done through main class
by hand. Program fails for anything but square matrices, but probably GUI will enforce those anyway. 

No code analysis done yet for time and space complexities


## TODO:

- Implement GUI and I/O files to use that.
- Do code analysis for time and space complexities.
- Option to GUI to run tests.
- Visualisation for test and comparison to theoretical complexity.
- Link javadoc and jacoco to automatically generated places from front page
