# Week 6

Time spent: 15 hours. 

## This week I:
  - Did the peer review
  - Build a GUI for the program (which took way longer than it should have)
  
## Todo:
 - Clean unused code and refactor
 - Improve documentation
 - Improve javadoc and unit tests
 - Analyze time complexity from algorithm structure
 - Add theoretical curves to GUI
 - Run longer tests
